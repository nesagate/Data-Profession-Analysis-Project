## Overview

This project analyzes data profession trends, focusing on job titles, industries, salary distributions, gender representation, education levels, and remote work preferences. The dataset consists of **285 survey respondents** and provides insights into key aspects of the data profession.

## Data Cleaning Process

The raw dataset required extensive cleaning before analysis. The following steps were performed:

1. **Standardized Job Titles** – Removed inconsistencies, merged similar titles, and categorized them appropriately.
2. **Industry Classification** – Ensured all job titles were assigned to a relevant industry, reducing the number of "Other" and "Unknown" values.
3. **Salary Formatting** – Converted salary ranges to numerical values, removed "k" from the dataset, and calculated the average salary per row.
4. **Handled Missing Values** – Investigated and reassigned missing industry data where possible.
5. **Ranked Industry Salaries** – Created a ranking system to determine the top-paying industries.
6. **Validated Data Integrity** – Cross-checked the cleaned data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Key Metrics & Insights

- **Most Common Job Title:** Data Analyst (211 respondents)
- **Highest-Paying Industry:** Healthcare (\$116K average salary)
- **Gender Representation:** Almost equal split between male and female respondents.
- **Preferred Education Level:** Bachelor's degree is the most common (153 respondents).
- **Remote Work vs Salary:** 51% of respondents prefer a better salary over remote work.
- **Python Usage:** 70% of respondents reported using Python.

## Dashboard Design

The dashboard was built using **Excel**, incorporating:

- **KPI Cards** to highlight overall statistics.
- **Bar Charts** for job title count, industry salary comparisons, and education levels.
- **Radar Chart** to visualize salary vs remote work preferences.
- **Pie Chart** for gender-based salary distribution.

## Next Steps

1. Share insights on **GitHub & LinkedIn** to showcase analytical skills.
2. Use this dataset for deeper statistical analysis with **SQL or Power BI**.
3. Explore **predictive modeling** on salaries based on job titles and industries.
